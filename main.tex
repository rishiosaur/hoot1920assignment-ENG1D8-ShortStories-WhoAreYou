    \item Programming
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Programming has taught me to think in creative but logical ways

\subsubsection*{Goals in School}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In past years, my goals for school have been to get great marks, and \textit{just} get great marks.
    \item However, this made me prize my self-worth on marks
    \item This led to me having a \textit{very} toxic attitude towards my friends and the people in my life.
    \item Eventually, I realized that marks were temporary, in a sense.
    \item They will always fluctuate, and there isn't really a point in putting your self-worth on test marks.
    \item This year, I'm putting a focus on my \textit{}

\subsubsection*{Someone I'd like to meet}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I'd like to meet Leibniz
    \item He was one of the greatest polymaths of the 17th and 18 centuries
    \item This era was also called the "Enlightenment era", simply because of the amount of maths and science that were going on at that time.
    \item Expertise ranged from maths to philosophy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One of his greatest achievements was creating the foundations of calculus
        \item This is one of my favorite units in math, and I would love to talk about item
        \item He was also a theologist, and I'd love to see what his thoughts were about religion at that time.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{First Draft}
I'm Rishi, a programmer, wannabe mathematician, and someone who values connection, all of which are big parts of my personality. I've been programming for about 6 years, and in that time, it's given me a couple of things: my logical attitude towards problems and a rather blunt personality. 

My interests and philosophy coincide almost perfectly with Leibniz, one of the greatest 17th-century polymaths. He was known for his work in the governments of old, consulting about topics ranging from math to philosophy to theology, and those consultations are \textit{exactly} why I want to talk to him. 
He was a pioneer of my favorite parts of math -calculus-, and helped develop the modern idea of God and philosophy in general. As a result, I feel that both of us would be able to take something away from our conversation: He could go back to the 17th century with a very strong idea of what the future holds, and I would be able to better understand function analysis, and what theology is \textit{supposed} to mean.
